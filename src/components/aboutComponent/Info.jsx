            I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA)
            with a specialization in Information Technology from Maharshi
            Dayanand University. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer
            Applications from Gurugram University and have also completed a Full
            Stack Web Development course in the MERN stack, with additional
            knowledge in DevOps. With hands-on experience in creating dynamic
            and responsive websites, I possess a strong understanding of
            front-end and back-end development. My expertise spans technologies
            like MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, allowing me to
            build efficient, scalable web applications. I am always eager to
            learn and explore the latest technologies, continually enhancing my
            skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
